    "This assignment will have us looking to build a deep convolutional neural network, similar to the architecture of LeNet-5\n",
    "\n",
    "This network will use the softmax function to make a 10 class image classification on the MNIST data set (the original MNIST and not the fashion_mnist we've been working with thusfar)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But before you get started, please make sure you have the following packages installed\n",
    "## Packages to install:\n",
    "1. numpy\n",
    "2. keras\n",
    "3. tensorflow\n",
    "4. matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "For keras and tensorflow, please refer to this link (https://docs.floydhub.com/guides/environments/) to make sure you install versions that are compatible with each other. I would highly recommend getting tensorflow==1.14.1 and the compatible keras version. The exact python version, as long as it's python3+, should not impact your ability to use these two packages.\n",

    "## Structure of Assigment ##\n",

    "What's new compared to PS3:\n",
    "1. **Convolutional Kernels**\n",
    "3. **Ensemble training**\n",

    "## Terminology\n",
    "Please look over the power point under Piazza > Resources > ConvolutionalNetwork.ppt to make sure you understand exactly what I mean when I type the following terms:\n",
    "1. Applying a kernel/filter\n",
    "2. Kernel/Filter\n",
    "3. Max Pool\n",
    "4. Feature map\n",
    "5. Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network Architecture\n",
    "![title](./ps4_img/leNet5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be implementing variations of LeNet-5 by hand, with flexible kernel shapes. In addition you will be implementing ensemble learning using LeNet-5. \n",
    "\n",
    "The static architecture can be seen above:\n",
    "1. 2 convolutional layers, each followed by a max-pooling layer\n",
    "2. 3 fully conected layers with an output shape of 10\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that each of the hidden convolutional outputs and max-pooling outputs are ??x?? or ?x? in terms of their dimensions. That is intentional as your first task is to figure out exactly what those are.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Kernel 1: 4 x 4, padding = 0, stride = 1\n",
    "2. Kernel 2: 4 x 4, padding = 0, stride = 1\n",
    "3. MaxPool1: 2 x 2, padding = 0, stride = 2\n",
    "4. MaxPool2: 2 x 2, padding = 0, stride = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "These kernel and maxpool sizes are values to start with. After you get the network working with these kernel and maxpool shapes, you will need to adjust it so it can take any valid kernel and any valid max pool shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we define valid as **out_shape is an integer greater than 1**, where $$out\\_shape = \\frac{input\\_shape + 2 * padding - kernel\\_shape}{stride} + 1$$\n",

    "Static Variables:\n",
    "1. Number of layers\n",
    "2. Output shape\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible variables:\n",
    "1. Kernel shapes\n",
    "2. MaxPool filter shapes\n",
    "3. Number of kernels per conv layer\n",
    "4. Number of nodes per FC layer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Grading and Procedure Recommendation ##\n",
    "This assignment overall has ??? points for all the methods you have to implement. Imposed on this total are the following percentages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you correctly implement all methods, and you can correctly apply one kernel per conv layer, you will earn 80% of the points\n",
    "2. Correct implementation of multiple kernels applied at each layer will earn you an additional 10%\n",
    "3. Correct implementation of ensemble learning will earn you an additional 5%\n",
    "4. Experimentation on parameters will earn you the last 5% of the points. See the bottom of this document for details\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you correctly implement all methods but do not have multiple kernels, nor ensemble training you will recieve (87 x 0.75) out of the possible 87. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you accomplish the situation above but also correctly add drop out and Ensemble training, you will then recieve (87 * 0.95) out of the possible 87.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how I recommend going about this assignment:\n",
    "1. Implement the network with batch training, weight decay, bias terms, and one kernel applied to each conv layer\n",
    "2. Add multiple kernels per conv layer functionality\n",
    "3. Add different kernel shape functionality\n",
    "4. Implement ensemble learning\n",
    "5. Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on \"different kernel shape\": \n",
    "For a convolutional network, all kernels applied at the same layer will be the **same shape**, when I say that your network should be able to handle differnt kernel shapes, that means if you change the kernel shape at a given layer, **all kernels applied on that layer will adopt the new shape**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, Kernel1 begins as a 4x4 kernel. This means if I wanted to apply multiple Kernel1's to the input layer, then I will apply multiple **4x4 kernels** (they are all the same shape). If I change my network such that Kernel1 is now a **6x6 kernel** that means ALL applications of kernel1 will now be 6x6.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that this assignment has very little headers and comments. I am leaving it up to you to decide exactly what info you need to incorporate for each function as a parameter, and the functionality and output of each that function. Feel free to use the previous problem sets as models for how to model your code. I recommend you continue to format your data in terms of N x M\n",
    "\n",
    "1. N = number of features\n",
    "2. M = number of data points\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loops during multi-kernel convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to not get you guys bogged down on dealing with 3D and 4D matrix multiplication, I will say the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of a single kernel should not impose any loops (straight matrix multiplication).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when you reach the stage of applying multiple kernels to a single layer, I would recommend you simply loop through all kernel matrices for that layer and apply them one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if your data begins as a NxM (2D matrix), then each kernel application will produce a (N1 x M) 2D matrix, where N1 = the flattened feature map of the kernel application. **These (N1 x M) matrices can be kept separately, rather than combining them into one 3D matrix. **\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data management\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using four data sets for this problem set. \n",
    "1. MNIST (the most popular computer vision data set)\n",
    "2. Dummy data (for testing purposes)"
